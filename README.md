# minini

Use INI files with shell!

---

## Why!?

If you're asking, you don't need it.

If you need it, you have my pity.

---

## Usage

```
minini somefile
```

The output should be able to be eval'd or exported into your shell script.

As INI accepts more flexible section/variable names, they do get mangled a little.

See the demo.ini and demo.out files to see how.

## Install

I could provide a method, but I won't.

If you absolutely need one, cp it into your PATH.

If you don't understand, you probably don't need this tool.
